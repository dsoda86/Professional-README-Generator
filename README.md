## Description
This application was created in order to save time and be an efficient way to create a README.md file for future projects. It uses node.js and the command line to run, give prompts via inquirer,
and then write the markdown file using the answers to the prompt questions. This template provides a baseline of a high quality README. More info can be added to the file after it has been generated if necessary.
As the first true backend application that I have created, I learned a lot about node.js, using npm and coding an index.js file to bring the installed dependencies together with functions to generate a new file from scratch.

## Contributors
In creating this application, I used/referenced the node.js module mini project as the main example of code to follow. I also used Chat GPT to help troubleshoot my createLicense Badge function in order for it to do what I wanted
and throw an error when answers did not meet my reuirements.
