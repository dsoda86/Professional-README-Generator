# Work Day Scheduler App

## Description
This scheduling app was created in order to have an easy way to save hourly tasks during a normal work day. The application will save and retrieve each hourly entry using local storage. The app runs in the browser and uses JQuery, Bootstrap, Day.js, and local storage. The date/time at the top updates every second. As time passes, each hour block's styling is updated to past, present, and future. I learned a lot about using time to dynamically update HTML and CSS as well as bettering my skills pertaining to setting and getting values from local storage.
